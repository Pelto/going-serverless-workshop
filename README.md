# going-serverless-workshop
A workshop on how to construct serverless applications on AWS


## Deploy everything

### 1. Package the backend

```
./scripts/package-stack.sh 
```

This will upload all of the lambda packages to S3 and generate an output file.


### 2. Deploy the backend

```
./scripts/deploy-stack --stack-name <stack-name>
```

Take note of the URL that the script returns. This will be needed in next step.

### 3. Configure the client to use the stack

Modify the file `rps-client/src/environments/environments.prod.ts` so that setting `apiUrl` points to the backend. (The full API Gateway URL including the basepath `/prod` is required).


### 4. Deploy the web app

Deploy the stack by `scripts/deploy-web.sh --stack-name <stack-name>`
